I wanted to make it as accessible as possible, so the game is fully playable using the keyboard. Something I'd like to add in the future is the functionality to make if fully playable using a screen reader and voice commands. I then spent a big amount of time styling it, which was also extremely rewarding, when it all came together in the end.",
