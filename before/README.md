## Personal Website

YEAH! My own website!

Check out this responsive animation that I did on svg elements in pure CSS!

This site was built using pure Javascript and CSS in the front, and a simple Node Express Server with Handlebars in the back.

It features an about me text, a contact section that uses AWS SES to send me an email and a portfolio section that uses express-handlebars to template the different portfolio pages.
