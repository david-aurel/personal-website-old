I have a background in Design and Film. \n Why code? Code gives me the possibility to create something that is more than just entertainment. Ideally, it solves an inconvenient problem in our life, like getting directions, payments, calling a friend. etc... It's a tool to create one the most worthwhile things of our time! \n Iâ€™m a hard worker and I obsess over what I make. I love being in a big problem slowly seeing everything click into place- This is even more rewarding when working with others as there is a power in collaboration and feeding off each otherâ€™s ideas."
